Problem Statement: Develop a multimedia project that utilizes image
processing, character segmentation, character recognition, and
morphological operations to detect car number plates. The system should
accurately identify the numbers on the number plate, display the detected
number, and save the image of the number plate for further analysis or
storage.

Description:
Our multimedia project is designed to automate the detection and
recognition of car number plates from video streams or laptop webcam
feeds. By leveraging advanced image processing techniques such as noise
reduction, object detection, edge detection, character segmentation,
morphological operations, and OCR algorithms, the system achieves
precise identification of number plates. It offers versatility by displaying
detected numbers in real-time within the video stream or webcam feed,
while also saving processed frames containing the number plate for
subsequent analysis or storage purposes.
